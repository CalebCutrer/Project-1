Title: Project 1- (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-March 2020 Pre-pandemic)
Members: Jim Pieper, Brittany Thomas, Caleb Cutrer, Melissa Judy

Focus: Analyze variables that impact an individual’s health. We plan on combining several datasets found on this website, including demographics, physical activity, sleep disorders/habits and prescription medicine use. The NHANES 2017-2020 survey reports health and nutrition information from adults and children obtained through direct evaluation and questionnaires. This approach from the CDC provides data from a large representation of the American population.

Research questions to answer: What conclusions can be drawn about external and internal forces on sleep patterns in the U.S. population?


Limitations: These data points were partially collected during the Covid-19 pandemic and therefore have limited information from the latter part, 2019-2020, when compared to information collected between 2017-2019.


Why: Healthcare is expensive and if there are ways to identify correlations between different attributes within a population subset, it provides an opportunity to create preventative plans.  It could benefit those who suffer from illnesses, as well as the whole of society.  Healthcare providers could plan better, educators could help establish healthy habits earlier, and families could be aware of genetic predispositions and other risk factors.

“Demographics” “Prescription Medication” “Physical Activity” “Sleep Disorders”

Goal: By using well sourced data from the CDC, we will look for connections in the data regarding indicators that might lead to a better understanding of sleep patterns for people.
